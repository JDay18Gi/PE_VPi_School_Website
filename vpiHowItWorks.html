    <h4>Our program is engineered to prepare you for success in business, certify your value to employers, and ensure you receive exceptional employment opportunities.  Here is how it works:</h4>

    <p> VPi limits the number of students we accept according to the number of students we are confident we can place into exceptional job opportunities.  We offer enrollment on a rolling basis.  Individuals eager to obtain access should submit an application to us as soon as possible.  Qualified students with applications on file will be reviewed for every enrollment opportunity including special opportunities and scholarship opportunities.  They will be notified regarding all opportunities for which they qualify.</p>

    <p><b>Length: 2-4 years</b></p>
    <p><b>Time: 20 or 40 loaded hours per week</b></p>
    <p><b>Location: Remote (internet and phone based)</b></p>

    <p>The VPi program does not require relocation.  (Students in rural areas will need to drive to the nearest city regularly.)  Participation in our program is completed over the phone and internet.  When a student finishes Phase One and begins to pursue internships, we help them obtain this locally or we set them up with a remote internship through one of our partners.  Some of our best opportunities may require relocation or even international travel, but these opportunities are optional not mandatory.</p>

    <p><b>The program is broken down into 2 phases:</b></p>

    <p>In Phase One, a student works through core business subjects important for every business professional and entrepreneur.  The curriculum is broken down into 4-week modules (full-time) or 8-week modules (part-time). These modules must be completed on time or repeated.  Students are consistently given 40 or 20 hours of assignments and projects respective to their full or part-time status.  Throughout both phases students have a mentor-manager who guides them through each module, tracks their progress, informs them when they are falling behind, and encourages them in their progress.  After completing Phase One, students receive an online certified resume at hirevanpelt.com which details their performance, abilities, and credentials.</p>

    <p>Phase Two begins the customized portion of the program.  Students work with a mentor-manager from VPi to identify which business areas they should focus on.  Then, collaborating with their mentor and the advice of a panel of VPi’s experienced businessmen, they forge a degree completion plan.  This plan will include 18 of the over 40 modules which VPi offers or approved custom modules designed and planned by the student in collaboration with his mentor.  The other 9 modules must be internship experience.  VPi ensures that all our students obtain internship opportunities with either our partners or another approved employer.</p>
