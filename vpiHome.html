     <p>The Van Pelt Institute is dedicated to one singular goal: developing the most sought-after employees and successful entrepreneurs.  Recent statistics have shown that the popular forms of preparation for employment and career advancement are failing miserably.  With 50% of recent college graduates unemployed or underemployed (1) and recent college graduates boasting of a higher unemployment rate than the general population of young people (2), VPi offers something distinctly different: a program dedicated to ensuring its students are thoroughly prepared for the professional world and obtain employment upon graduation.  VPi actively pursues and maintains relationships with dozens of employers, growing businesses, and entrepreneurs.  We have developed a five-fold method of ensuring our students receive exceptional job offers before or upon graduation.  Our website, hirevanpelt.com is devoted entirely to recruiting employers to hire our students. </p>
