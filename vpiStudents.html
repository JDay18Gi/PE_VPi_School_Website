    <p>The VPi program appeals to individuals who:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Desire to be in a fast-paced innovative business environment yesterday</li>
      <li>Are excited about entrepreneurship, finance, economics, and marketing</li>
      <li>Are frustrated with college classes and feel they are a waste of time and life</li>
      <li>See capitalism and hard work as honorable life-long pursuits</li>
      <li>Long to develop excellence and drive in their career</li>
    </ul>

    <p>How would you like to join a tight-knit group of driven entrepreneurs and business professionals aspiring to radically change the face of business education?</p>

    <p>Military training is known for its difficulty, but the intensity of training is in accordance with the job.  So too, VPi is not easy because neither is the real world.  Being successful in business takes personal discipline, character, motivation, mental fortitude, training, practice, mentorship, and innovation among other things.  Those who think they will be prepared by reading through a few textbooks, going to 5 classes a week, and studying on the couch with their Starbucks and music are gravely mistaken.  There is a reason that the average young person with no college is more likely to have a job than a recent college graduate.  A young person with 4 years of proven work performance, no matter how low their position, is better prepared for the rigors of the work world than the average student graduating from college.</p>

    <p> From day one our students review the following list of resolves daily:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Resolved, to always do right no matter the consequences.</li>
      <li>Resolved, to place principle above personal gain.</li>
      <li>Resolved, to never tolerate mediocrity in my life.</li>
      <li>Resolved, to live with all my might while I do still live.</li>
      <li>Resolved, to constantly labor to make my best better, my efficient more effective, and my service more exceptional.</li>
    </ol>
