    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <h3>College is dead. Employers are overwhelmed.</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="row" id="row2">

    <p>One of the critical components of our program is an emphasis on creating innovative problem solvers. In this spirit, VPi is a solution to some serious problems in business education.  The disconnect between college and the real business world continues to increase.</p>

    <p class="quote"> “A college degree once looked to be the path to prosperity.[...] Times have changed.” </p> <p class="sig">— Doug French</p>

    <h4>Low Return + High Cost = High Risk</h4>

    <p>Attending college requires taking great risk for most individuals especially in today’s economy.  This risk is taken with the hope that it will bring students a better job and future.  However, statistics show that this is a dwindling prospect:</p>

    <h4>Low Return:</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>17 million Americans with college degrees are working jobs that require less than the skill level associated with that degree (1,2).</li>
      <li>Studies have found that 25% of recent college graduates were unemployed one year after graduation and another 25% were underemployed (3,4).</li>
      <li>The unemployment rate among people under the age of twenty-five (18.4%) is actually lower than the unemployment rate of recent college graduates (25%).  This means that you are more likely to have a job if you are under the age of 25 than if you graduated college last year (4).</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="quote">“By those measures, college grads are actually faring worse in the job market than the overall youth population. They’re also suffering terribly compared to the older college-educated populace”</p> <p class="sig">— The Atlantic</p>

    <p>Sources:</p>
    <p>(1) The Chronicle: “Why did 17 Million Students go to College?”</p>
    <p>(2) The Mises Institute: “The Higher-Education Bubble Has Popped”</p>
    <p>(3) The New York Times: “Many With New College Degree Find the Job Market Humbling.”</p>
    <p>(4) The Atlantic: “The Atlantic: “53% of Recent College Graduates are Jobless or Underemployed—How?”</p>

    <h4>VPi Remedy:</h4>

    <p>VPi has developed a five-fold strategy for ensuring that we maintain a 100% employment rate among our graduates:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Our program offers unmatched training, education, and preparation for the professional business world.  Our students are equipped with skills that make them of preeminent value to employers.</li>
      <li>VPi is committed to maintain a growth rate in accordance with the relationships we maintain with employers.  Our credibility as an institution is dependent upon our students being able to obtain employment upon graduation. We are committed to never sacrificing the employment of our graduates for profits.  We will turn students down if we are not confident we can place them in an exceptional job upon graduation.</li>
      <li>VPi actively pursues employers and educates them on the quality of our students and program.  We offer complementary recruiting services to employers and maintain a website just for them: hirevanpelt.com.</li>

      <img src="images/NYC_Sunset.jpeg" alt="City Sunset Photo">

      <li>After successfully completing Phase One of our program, students receive a personal webpage on our site.  This page acts as a certified online resume backed by the strength and integrity of the Van Pelt Institute for Excellence in Business.  This acts as a third-party testament to one's qualifications and provides a place for employers to find exceptional candidates.</li>
      <li>Finally, after graduation, we aggressively work to find employment for our students for up to 6 months free of charge.  This includes bimonthly calls with their manager-mentor who will actively seek out opportunities and coach the graduate through applying, interviewing, etc. For most students, this extra help will not be necessary, but we guarantee it as extra insurance.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>High Cost:</h4>

    <p>VPi has developed a five-fold strategy for ensuring that we maintain a 100% employment rate among our graduates:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the average total cost for a 4-year public school is $60,000 and $131,000 for a 4-year private school (1).</li>
      <li>The average college graduate has around $26,000 worth of student debt (2).</li>
      <li>TThe cost of college tuition has risen by 440% in the last 25 years (3).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Sources:</p>
    <p>(1) National Center for Education Statistics</p>
    <p>(2) The Economist, “Not what it used to be”</p>
    <p>(3) Cato Institute, “Cato Handbook for Policymakers 7th Edition,” p. 229-234.</p>

    <h4>VPi Remedy:</h4>

    <p>The cost breakdown of VPi can be viewed in detail here.  Students who complete our program in 2 years will spend approximately $10,900 total (including books and other expenses) while students who spend 4 years at VPi will spend approximately $18,720. Even 4 years of our program costs less than one year of the average 4-year institution.  The cost of VPi can be easily recovered in one year of suitable employment compared to the 3-6 years it would take for the average college graduate to recoup their $60,000.  That is assuming they are among the 50% that actually obtain a career advancement upon graduation.  To further reduce the risk of our program, we offer a free one-month trial with no payment information required.  Students may pay month to month and quit at any time.</p>

    <h4>Failing Fundamentals</h4>

    <p>Finally, the fundamentals in the average college business degree are nonexistent:</p>

    <p><b>1.  Failure to Ensure Quality of Character</b>The typical college business program has only one channel - academic knowledge.  It ignores the fact that many individuals, despite being intelligent, lack personal traits necessary for success in business.  Character elements like personal discipline, respect, teachability and initiative are not evaluated.</p>

    <p><b>2.  Failure to Ensure Competency of Skill</b>Consider the following skills that the average business student in college is never tested in: marketing, execution, customer service, strategic planning, innovation, and negotiation.  Students never get the chance to try these skills let alone hone them.  There is a massive disconnect between the classroom and the real world.  Success in college requires only a few of the many skills necessary for success in business.</p>

    <p><b>3.  Failure to Ensure Potency of Knowledge</b>The content of the average college business class is not developed by successful entrepreneurs or business professionals. Theorists in their ivory towers, along with the influence of special interest groups, write textbooks filled with information that becomes largely irrelevant the day the class is completed.  Instead of reading the best sellers that successful businessmen on the streets are, students are stuck reading academic fluff.</p>

    <p><b>4. Failure to Ensure Consistency of Credibility</b>With the exception of a few solid institutions, most colleges turn out a disparagingly wide range of quality among their graduates.  More than half of our working population has a college degree and today a degree means very little in regard to credibility. Colleges have failed to facilitate and encourage the pursuit of a full spectrum of credibility.</p>
